The Python version used is Python 3.4

To run the BEE2 client you'll need PyGame:
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame

To compile vbsp and vrad you'll need cx_freeze:
http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#cx_freeze
To compile run "compile_vbsp_vrad.py" with an argument of "-build".
The files will be in build/. 
VBSP also reqiures a copy of vbsp_config.cfg in the bin/ folder as well, with the originals named vbsp_original and vrad_original. Leave VVIS alone.
