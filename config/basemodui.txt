//Puzzlecraft Tips (WIP)
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_00"				"Keep goals clear: The puzzle exit should always be visible upon entry."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_01"				"Keep puzzles simple. Players should be able to keep the solution in their head."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_02"				"Keep puzzles transparent. Players should always see the effect of pressing buttons. Avoid putting things in separate rooms."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_03"				"Keep puzzles about the cerebral challenge, not the execution: Puzzles should be easy to solve once players know the solution."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_04"				"If you want your puzzle to be broadly played and enjoyed, don't make players rely on precise timing or 'ninja' FPS skills."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_05"				"Twitchy puzzles that require precise timing are less fun for most players. Expect a smaller audience."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_06"				"Maintain a sense of progression: Split up large puzzles into a series of smaller experiences."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_07"				"Maintain a sense of progression: Avoid puzzles that force the player to revisit the same area again and again."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_08"				"Puzzles are a contest between author and player where the player is ALWAYS expected to win in the end."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_09"				"Good puzzles are not so tricky to be frustrating, but just tricky enough to make players feel smart when they solve it."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_10"				"Keep it simple: Fewer puzzle elements arranged in a clear, strong way are better than many elements organized in a tangled knot."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_11"				"Playtest early and often to know what parts your audience finds too easy or too hard."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_12"				"Keep t-beams away from buttons where they can accidentally lift placed buttons or players."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_13"				"Avoid lasers that are always in the players movement path: they can get annoying really fast."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_14"				"It's okay to have more than one way to solve a puzzle, just be aware that the alternatives exist and that they don't ruin the puzzle."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_15"				"When you add another mechanic to your puzzle, you're increasing complexity -- make sure each added mechanic justifies its existence by contributing something interesting to the puzzle."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_16"				"Find a fun central concept for the puzzle and design back from there."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_17"				"Be careful not to put critical elements on the ceiling. Players rarely look up (or down) unless guided to."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_18"				"There should be a twist in every map. Players get more enjoyment when they figure the twist than when they actually solve the puzzle. The ideal case builds a lot of suspense. 'Whoa! I think this might work' ... [tries crazy idea] ... 'That's awesome! I can't believe I did that!'"
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_19"				"Avoid straightforward puzzles. They are boring."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_20"				"Players can't judge how far they will fling - try to avoid making a puzzle with multiple options for a fling where players need to choose the same one."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_21"				"Don't make a space that allows for an infini-fling unless it is part of the puzzle. When players are stumped they will frequently try this mechanic. It's also a complicated maneuver so it's possible to fail for a long time before you realize that it's not how to solve the puzzle."
"PORTAL2_PuzzleEditor_Hint_Puzzlecraft_22"				"Avoid creating linear puzzles in linear spaces."
